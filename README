How to Compile and Run the code

Step 1:
Extract the Chat.zip file and below are its contents
1) Peer.java -  The main class file
2) PingSender.java - Periodically sends ping messages to all connected neighbors
3) PingListener.java - Receives and processes Hellos, HelloAcks, Messages and files
4) CommandListener.java - Listens to commands from users such as broadcast, chat , find friend and send files
5) Listener.java - Actively listens for new connections
6) FileListener.java - The thread that was supposed to process files. Not used now.
7) peers.csv - the file where all peers register details about themselves
8) send/apple.txt - the test file that we use for sending to Peers
9) recv directory - the directory where received files are stored per node

Step 2:
Open a command line and navigate to the location of the extracted folder
Type the below command
javac *.java

Step 3:
Make sure the peers.csv file is clear

Step 4:
Open a new command prompt for every instance of Peer which you wish to run
Type the below command
java Peer

Step 5:
A running instance of Peer has the below functionalities
1) Initially will request you for a user name. Will accept only if no user by the same name exists
2) If the very first user, it listens for new users to connect to it
3) Else, will display list of users in the chat room and ask how many of them you would like to connect with
4) Upon entering the number of users, you want to connect with, it prompts for their names
5) Any node at any point can type 'find friend' to identify new users and connect to them
6) Typing 'broadcast ANYMESSAGE YOU WANT' will send it to all users it is currently connected to
7) Typing 'chat @ USERNAME ANY MESSAGE' will send encrypted message to the particular user alone
8) Typing 'send file' will prompt for user to send file to. The file will be received in the folder 'recv'
9) hello and Hello acks are exchanged between all connected users
10) When a user crashes, the connected users display an appropriate message and also remove its details from their hash table
